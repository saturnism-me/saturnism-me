## Abstract
Often we hear people talk about “great developer experience” but what does that mean?  It seems to be like “beauty” – in the eye of the beholder. Yet, great developer experience (DX) is 100% about developer productivity and can be measured in terms of value and time. There are 4 key principles that help guide us to deliver value and reduce friction to increase productivity and thus deliver experiences which developers will love.  These principles address the entire surface area of what developers interact with: the actual product, the documentation, and the tools.
