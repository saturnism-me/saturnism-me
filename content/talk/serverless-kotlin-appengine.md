## Abstract
After years of development of a new security sandbox, App Engine Standard now supports Java 8 and practically all of the JVM languages that runs atop of standard OpenJDK 8. In the new sandbox environment, we removed the Java security sandbox and the classes whitelist; this allows developers to use all features in the JVM and still being protected within a secure environment.

App Engine can now support powerful frameworks like Spring Boot, Dropwizard with all the Java 8 language features. Best of all, you can run any JVM languages, including Groovy & Kotlin.

We'll show you how to use Kotlin end-to-end to build from an Android mobile client and also the backend with Kotlin & Spring Boot that can be quickly deployed and capable of scaling from 0 to infinity.
