## Abstract
Debugging applications in production is like being the detective in a crime movie. Especially with microservices. Especially with containers. Especially in the cloud. Trying to see whatâ€™s going on in a production deployment at scale is impossible without proper tools! Google has spent over a decade deploying containerized Java applications at unprecedented scale and the infrastructure and tools developed by Google have made it uniquely possible to manage, troubleshoot, and debug, at scale.

Join this session to see how you can diagnose and troubleshoot production issues w/ out of the box Kubernetes tools, as well as getting insight from the ecosystem with Weave Scope, JFrog Artifactory & Stackdriver tools.
