## Abstract
Join this talk to learn how you can quickly create a Kotlin backend service using Spring Boot, and use Spring Cloud GCP to leverage many of the useful Google Cloud services for database, storage, and observability in minutes. These services are fully managed, so you don't need to spend any time setting up and managing new infrastructure. Instead, you can just focus on the code. When the backend is ready, we'll deploy it to our serverless platform, where your backend service can automatically scale up the number of instances based on load, but can also scale down to zero instances when no one is using it.
