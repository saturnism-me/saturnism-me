## Abstract
Spring Framework and Spring Boot have made huge strides in making it easier than ever to develop the next generation of cloud native applications. Importantly, a number of Spring projects provide cloud-vendor agnostic abstractions to developers so that with a simple configuration switch, you're able to move your local application to run in an on prem datacenter or in the cloud with managed services.
 
Google and Pivotal partnered to develop Spring Cloud adapters for Google Cloud Platform. With Spring Cloud GCP, you can quickly develop cloud native applications and harness the power of Google infrastructure. We'll introduce a number of projects we've been working on, including: Spring Cloud Sleuth integration to send trace data to Stackdriver Trace, Spring Data for Cloud Spanner to quickly access globally distributed Spanner database with Object Relational Mapping, Spring Integration channel adapters for Cloud Pub/Sub to use with Spring Messaging, Spring Boot Starters for Google Cloud SQL to quickly connect to managed MySQL or PostgreSQL databases, and Spring Resource abstraction for Cloud Storage to inject shared file resources. In this session, we'll show how to build cloud native applications with Spring on Google Cloud Platform.
