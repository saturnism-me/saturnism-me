## Abstract
Enterprises are moving applications to the cloud to increase operational agility. However, most of the migrations are lift and shift that don't really take full advantage of Cloud services. Google Cloud Platform is the first to bring awesome end-to-end experiences for Java application development, from writing with the most popular framework, Spring and Spring Boot, to plugins for Maven, Gradle, Eclipse, and IntelliJ, and to deployment options for PaaS, containers, and more. But this is not enough. To truly run and operate the application in production, we'll also take a look at how to add trace, logging, and prometheus monitoring to your application to extract essential metrics. Join this talk to see how to start from scratch and see how the integrated experience and managed Cloud services help you increase velocity to production.
