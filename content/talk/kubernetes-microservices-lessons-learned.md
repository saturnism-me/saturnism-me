## Abstract
Ray has been on a 6-months rotation with an internal Google team to help bringing a project to public Cloud using cloud-native technology stack and Kubernetes. Ray will share the architecture, development environment technicals, devops tools, and some tough decisions that needed to be made to move the project along while being prepared for changes in the future. This session to learn the journey including development environment tools choices (Docker Compose, Skaffold, Kustomize, Jib), to the stack (Gradle, Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, gRPC, gRPC-Web), to mono-repo vs multi-repo, to the runtime infrastructure (Kubernetes, Istio, Prometheus, Grafana). With hindsight 20-20, weâ€™ll visit some best practices, lessons learned, and how decisions/compromises are being made.
