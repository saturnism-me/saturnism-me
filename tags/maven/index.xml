      <description>Abstract As a developer advocate working with customers, Ray has seen all sorts of issues due to dependency conflicts. Dependency conflicts come in many different forms and have different impacts on your applications. This presentation examines common causes of a dependency conflict, how you can mitigate it as a library developer, and how end users can resolve it. It also covers what Google has been documenting in terms of best practices and what tools it has created to help, based on its learnings.</description>
