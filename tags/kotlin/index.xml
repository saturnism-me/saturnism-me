      <title>Developing Backends with Kotlin and Spring Boot on Google Cloud</title>

      <description>Abstract Join this talk to learn how you can quickly create a Kotlin backend service using Spring Boot, and use Spring Cloud GCP to leverage many of the useful Google Cloud services for database, storage, and observability in minutes. These services are fully managed, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend any time setting up and managing new infrastructure. Instead, you can just focus on the code. When the backend is ready, we&amp;rsquo;ll deploy it to our serverless platform, where your backend service can automatically scale up the number of instances based on load, but can also scale down to zero instances when no one is using it.</description>

      <description>Abstract Enterprises are moving applications to the cloud to increase operational agility. However, most of the migrations are lift and shift that don&amp;rsquo;t really take full advantage of Cloud services. Google Cloud Platform is the first to bring awesome end-to-end experiences for Java application development, from writing with the most popular framework, Spring and Spring Boot, to plugins for Maven, Gradle, Eclipse, and IntelliJ, and to deployment options for PaaS, containers, and more.</description>

      <title>Serverless Kotlin with App Engine</title>
      <link>https://saturnism.me/talk/serverless-kotlin-appengine/</link>

      <description>Abstract After years of development of a new security sandbox, App Engine Standard now supports Java 8 and practically all of the JVM languages that runs atop of standard OpenJDK 8. In the new sandbox environment, we removed the Java security sandbox and the classes whitelist; this allows developers to use all features in the JVM and still being protected within a secure environment.
App Engine can now support powerful frameworks like Spring Boot, Dropwizard with all the Java 8 language features.</description>
