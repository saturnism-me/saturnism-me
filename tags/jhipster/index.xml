      <description>Abstract Ray Tsang from Google contributed a couple of generators for JHipster, including the initial Kubernetes support, Istio support, and Google App Engine support. In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to use these generators to quickly create and deploy JHipster applications into these environments. We&amp;rsquo;ll also look at the latest work being done on thin microservices architecture such that circuit breakers, retries, load balancing and more are delegated to Istio.</description>
